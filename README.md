I wonder how this works. 

basic git commands :

git clone <github link ending in .git> 		-- makes a copy of the github repo as a child directory
git add <file(s)> 							-- add files ready for commit
git commit -m "Commit text"					-- commits files to local repo (before its uploaded) with description
git push
